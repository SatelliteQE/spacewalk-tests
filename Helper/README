# Q: How can I use this rpm in my test?

    * (1) Add requires into your Makefile
@echo "RhtsRequires: test(/CoreOS/Spacewalk/Helper)" >> $(METADATA)
    * (2) Add sourcing to your runtest.sh
rlRun "/mnt/tests/CoreOS/Spacewalk/Helper/runtest.sh"
    * (3) Now you can remove all other dependencies from your Makefile.

# Q: What is the difference between this helper and Spacewalk/Helper?

	This is a fork of a Satellite Helper created when a decision was made to remove entitlements
	from the Spacewalk. it means Spacewalk and Satellite are going to be more different than before
	and it makes sense to have a helper for each.
	This helper is just a copy of the original Spacewalk helper and might contain Satellite-incompatible
	code. It will only be updated when we encounter a buggy behavior.
